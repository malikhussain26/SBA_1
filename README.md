<p>I created this project to showcase my HTML and CSS skills and my overall progression as a web developer. 
My goal was to develop a website with three different pages, while upholding the continuity throughout. 
This project helped me gain an understanding of HTML and CSS as well as keeping the user experience in mind. 
It solves the problem that many people face, that is showing people how to have fun with your diet yet still eating clean though meal prepping.
what stands out most is the neatness of the styling, that was the area that I needed to improve the most and I believe that I addressed that area.
